/**
 * Record Button — Layer 2 · §7.22
 * §7.19 Voice Note's capture step, collapsed into ONE control: the primary
 * CTA. Two states on one target — ready ⇄ recording — and every switch resets
 * the clock, so there is no third "recorded" state to explain.
 *
 * COMPOSED ON §7.4 CTA BUTTON, NOT A NEW BUTTON. Same target ladder
 * (44 / 56 / 64), same six-state model, same pill. Two extra parts: the meter
 * (`.musy-rec__meter`) and the readout (`.musy-rec__time`).
 *
 * THE STATE IS NOT CARRIED BY HUE. The button stays primary while live —
 * swapping to the error family would paint a working control as a failure, and
 * §19's red-while-live belongs to a surface, not to the screen's main action.
 * Three cues change instead: the glyph (mic → stop), the label ("Record Now" →
 * "Recording Running") and the meter, which only exists while recording. It
 * survives greyscale and forced colours (1.4.1).
 *
 * THE METER IS DECORATIVE, THE COUNTER IS NOT. Bars are aria-hidden and take
 * currentColor, so they follow the button's ink in every variant. What a
 * screen-reader user gets is the readout — seconds in, seconds left, in a
 * `role="status"` region. The same split §19 made between its pulsing dot and
 * its live time.
 *
 * FULLY CONTROLLED, AND NO MEDIA. The component draws `levels`; it never calls
 * getUserMedia, never encodes, and does not hold the 60-second timer. The app
 * that owns the recorder owns both, and calls `onLimit` when `maxSeconds` is
 * reached — which is what lets one component drive a real recorder and a
 * simulated one with no prototype branch inside the design system.
