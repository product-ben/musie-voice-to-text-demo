/**
 * Interactive Wizard — Layer 2 · §7.17
 * The interactive sibling of §7.8 Process Visualisation: same step geometry,
 * but each step is a real <button> inside <nav><ol>, and the step on screen
 * carries `aria-current="step"`. Process Visualisation deliberately has no
 * current-step state — that is this component, and keeping them apart is what
 * stops a non-interactive explainer from growing a tap affordance.
 *
 * No APG pattern and no base-ui primitive: a wizard is navigation, so it is a
 * <nav> containing an ordered list of buttons. Roving focus is NOT applied —
 * these are links-in-spirit, every one is a tab stop, which is what a user
 * expects from a navigation region.
 *
 * REACHABILITY IS THE COMPONENT'S RULE, not the consumer's: every completed
 * step stays reachable, so going back is always allowed; the only unreachable
 * step is one whose predecessors are unfinished. That rule lives here so two
 * screens cannot disagree about it.
 *
 * Four states, and they are a progression rather than a palette:
 *   disabled → active → selected → completed
 * Selection changes the marker FILL and the label WEIGHT; completion changes
 * the GLYPH (number → check). No state rests on hue (1.4.1).
 *
 * Narrow screens COLLAPSE rather than stack: the step on screen keeps its
 * label, every other step shrinks to its marker. The hidden labels are moved
 * out of sight, not removed, so a marker-only step still announces its name.
